                        It is an electric vehicle that uses fuel cell to power the motor.

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                   <p style="padding-left: 10px;">Energy is a factor which determine a country’s economy, transportation, and standard of life. The problem faced globally is the consumption and the availability of energy. <br><br>
                   There are two main problems of continuous using of fossil fuels - <br>
                   1) Limited amount of fossil fuel.<br>
                   2) Cause due to fossil fuel to environment such as Global Warming, Acid Rain, Pollution, etc.<br><br>
                   To supply more amount of energy for increasing population, alternative is to u-se electricity for vehicles.<br><br>
                   It is the cleanest and efficient fuel.<br><br>
                   The alternative to fossil fuels represented by other energy sources such as: battery systems, ultracapacitors or fuel cells.<br><br>
                   FCEVs can reduce emission to some extent but not to zero.<br><br>
                   Thus, the renewable energy transport allows FCEVs to become preferable choice.<br>

                  <h3>Information</h3>
                 <p style="padding-left: 5px;">Fuel cells in vehicles generate electricity generally using oxygen from the air and compressed hydrogen.<br><br>
                 Most of the fuel cell vehicles are classifies as zero emissions vehicle that emits only heat and water.<br><br>
                 There are various types of fuel cell systems. But the principle function is same.<br><br>
            

                 <h3>Principle of FCEVs</h3><p style="padding-left: 10px;">For fuel cell system anode, cathode and electrolyte are required.<br>
                 The electrolyte is in between the cathode and the anode.<br> 
                 Fuel (hydrogen) is in the anode compartment of the fuel cell and the air or pure oxygen is in the cathode compartment.<br> 
                 On anode side of cell, electrons are separated as the gas tries to make its way through the electrolyte membrane.<br>
                 Membrane act as filter to separate hydrogen ions and electrons.<br>
                 In this way, electricity is formed and supplied to motor to drive the wheels.<br> Water as well as heat is the by-product of the fuel cell.<br>
